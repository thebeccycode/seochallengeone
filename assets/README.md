# seochallengeone
search engine optimization (challenge 1)

##Description

The aim of this project was to edit this website in order to make the website more accessible through search engine optimization (SEO). Whilst working through the project I learnt a lot, and it highlighted areas of which I need to improve in. For example, I wasn't sure how I could make elements semantic and have the CSS still work after having made those changes. There were times I attempted these things and then realised I needed to do some research. I have tried to SEO and hopefully the website is a little cleaner than I found it.

##How to use

To make changes; clone the repository to your CPU, create a new branch and once you have made the changes you want, use the CLI to 'push' your branch to the main. It would also be good to start an 'issue' and explain what your aims are to streamline this process. Alternatively if you would just like to open it, click on the url provided.

##issues

At first my html and css wasn't connecting properly, but after reconfiguring the folders and checking my stylesheet link, it finally displayed the page as expected:
